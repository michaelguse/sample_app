### Intro

This is the prototype application for the Sales & Marketing Solution for organizations operating
products that are being sold via a retail distribution business arm. 

For example, the automotive industry in the U.S consists of the manufacturing company with their 
sales and marketing organization headquartered mostly on the east (European manufacturers) or the 
west coast (Japanase manufacturers).

Automotive manufaturers sell a large part of their vehicles through dealerships, which are mostly 
independently owned, unless the manufacturer has "grand-fathered" dealerships.

Dealerships and/or customers are being given incentives by the manufacturing company to help them 
increase their sales of specific vehicles that are experiencing: 

- potential slow down in sales lately
- competitors launched new vehicle, which directly competes
- manufacturer introduced new model, which might cannabalize sales level for existing models
- larger upcoming production volume than sales forecast predicts
- etc.

### Todo
- complete overview
- state goal/purpose of the prototype
